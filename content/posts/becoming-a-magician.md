I've always been drawn to magic, the kind that sparks awe, wonder, and possibility.
Lately, I've also been coming to terms with the possibility that I may have ADHD. While brainstorming ways to better support myself, a playful idea surfaced: What if I became the magician of my own life?

I read that the core struggle for people with executive dysfunction is bridging the gap between visualizing what they want to do and actually doing it. Planning can offer a sense of accomplishment without the follow-through. That resonated. It explains the trail of failed New Year's resolutions, abandoned vision boards, and half-filled bullet journals I’ve left behind.

I have no doubt my ability to plan is exceptional—I've spent years refining it. But that’s often where my energy ends: at the beautiful, detailed blueprint stage.
