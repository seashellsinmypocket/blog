I am on a staycation and enjoying time relaxing. I went birding a few days back and here are few things that I thought of while birding.

I am in control of the life I want to create. I was unable to visit Muir woods because of valid reasons, but I didn't let that affect how the rest of the day unfolded. One of the reasons was that I was exhausted to do the 1 hour drive to Muir Woods. So I tried to come up with ideas of what I could do to change the trajectory of my day and make it better. I decided to go for a shorter drive to a forested park closeby that gave me similar opportunities for birding and forest bathing.

I was lucky to see two types of woodpecker on this birding trip and thought that was possible only because of the decisions I made leading up to that moment including overcoming my fear of trail lizards and walking alone with no one around. I think there is a difference between listening to my intuition for signs of danger and talking myself into doing things outside my comfort zone. In this case, I realized it was the latter and started a short hike up the trail. I didn't get very far along the trail when I was gifted the sight of these wonderful woodpeckers. 

I also was kind to myself since I was exhausted. My knees were starting to hurt. I had an option to push through and then suffer the pain or be happy with the short hike and spend the rest of the visit relaxing and being kind to my knees. And that is exactly what I did!

I was happy with the trip that I ended with a nice session of reading under the forest trees.
